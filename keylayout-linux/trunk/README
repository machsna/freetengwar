Tengwar Unicode keyboard layout (based on US-QWERTY)

This layout is part of the Free Tengwar Font Project. For more
information, see http://freetengwar.sourceforge.net/


INSTALLATION

If you are using Ubuntu, you can install the layout using the
automatic script. This has been tested on Ubuntu 8.04, 8.10,
9.04, and 9.10. Use at your own risk.

$ chmod +x install.sh
$ sudo ./install.sh

If successful, the script will also generate an uninstall script.

If you prefer to install manually, first move ucteng to
"the right place". Where this is depends on your Linux version.
The following works for the latest versions of Ubuntu:

$ sudo cp ucteng /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/

Then edit "the right file". Again, on the latest version of Ubuntu,
this is /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml, but your system
may be configured differently. When you have found the file, add
the following code just before "</layoutList>"

    <layout>
      <configItem>
        <name>ucteng</name>
        <shortDescription>Tengwar</shortDescription>
        <description>Tengwar Unicode</description>
        <languageList><iso639Id>art</iso639Id></languageList>
      </configItem>
      <variantList/>
    </layout>

After a successfull installation, you will have to enable the
keyboard layout. If you are using GNOME, you may find this option
under System, Preferences, Keyboard, Layouts. You will also want
to add the Keyboard Indicator panel to your system bar.
