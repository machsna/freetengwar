Tengwar Unicode keyboard layout (based on US-QWERTY)

This layout is part of the Free Tengwar Font Project. For more
information, see http://freetengwar.sourceforge.net/

INSTALLATION

This layout should be usable on at least Windows 2000, Windows XP,
Windows Vista and Windows 7. To install, simply run Setup.exe.
To configure your keyboard layouts after installation, choose
Regional and Language Options in the Control Panel.

NOTE: If you are updating from an earlier version of this layout,
you should probably completely remove it first, before installing
the new version. The old version is uninstalled just like a program:
go to Add or Remove Programs in the Control Panel.

If you want to modify the layout, you can edit the source file
tengucqw.klc with the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator:
