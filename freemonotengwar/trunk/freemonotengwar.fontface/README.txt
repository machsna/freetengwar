FreeMonoTengwar.fontface

Purpose
-------

The FreeMonoTengwar.fontface font is based on the 2009-12-14 FreeMonoTengwar font, which is in turn based on the FreeMono.sfd of the 2009-01-04 GNU FreeFont. The FreeMonoTengwar.fontface font aims at being as small as possible while still covering all the tengwar characters, in order to serve for inclusion on webpages through the CSS3 @font-face selector.

Furthermore, the script makes use of a number of ligatures. This is just an imperfect ad-hoc solution due to the difficulties of adding advanced features to the Personal Use Area. These ligatures have been added to encoding points FontForge promised not to interfere with Unicode, so I hope this is alright.

Editing
-------

The free outline font editor, George Williams's FontForge <http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/> is used for editing the fonts.

Files and their suffixes
------------------------

The files with .sfd (Spline Font Database) are in FontForge's native format. Please use these if you plan to modify the font files.

TrueType fonts for immediate consumption are the files with the .ttf (TrueType Font) suffix.  These are ready to use in Xwindows based systems using FreeType, on Mac OS, and on older Windows systems.

OpenType fonts (with suffix .otf) are for use in Windows Vista. Note that although they can be installed on Linux, but many applications in Linux still don't support them.
