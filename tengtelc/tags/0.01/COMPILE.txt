The compilation of Tengwar Telcontar from source files to a working Graphite ("smart font" enabled) TrueType typeface consists of two steps: I.) the generating of bare TrueType fonts from the METAFONT sources, and II.) adding Graphite tables to the resulting fonts. You will only have to perform the first step if you want to add or modify the glyphs in the typeface. If you only want to modify the smart font behaviour of the typeface, i.e. rules for glyph substitution and the like, you can skip the first step, and add the modified Graphite tables to the bare precompiled TrueType fonts that are also included in the source distribution.

Note: If you haven't done any changes to the METAFONT nor to the Graphite sources, there is no reason (except for the sheer fun of it) for you to recompile Tengwar Telcontar. Since a TrueType font is platform independent (or should be...), you can just as well use the binary distribution.

I.) To compile the Tengwar Telcontar source to TrueType font files,
   you will need the following software:

 0.) An OS that can run all of the following software (duh!),
    i.e. some Linux distribution of your choise, or, if you use
    MS Windows, Cygwin: http://www.cygwin.com/

 1.) Python. This is probably included in your Linux distribution.
    (Don't forget to manually include it if/when you install Cygwin
    -- it isn't selected for installation by default.)

 2.) METAFONT. Usually comes boundled in TeX-distributions
    (e.g. MikTeX, teTeX etc.).

 3.) The newest version of FontForge:
    http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/

 4.) A tracing program, AutoTrace or potrace. I recommend the later:
    http://potrace.sourceforge.net/

II.) To add Graphite tables to the resulting fonts, you will need:

 0.) Graphite Compiler. Note: Only available for MS Windows!

Here, as a reference, is how I set up a minimal system to compile Tengwar Telcontar, starting from a normal Windows XP installation:

0.) From http://www.miktex.org/setup.html I downloaded and installed the "Small MikTeX" package. No problems, except that it seems that the path to the MikTeX binaries is sometimes not added to the PATH variable, which means that METAFONT (mf) will not be found. To remedy this, open the Control Panel, System, Advanced, Environment Variables, and then edit Path, by appending something like ";c:\texmf\miktex\bin". (The exact appearance of the path is of course dependent on where you installed MikTeX.)

1.) Next I went to http://www.cygwin.com/ and followed the link "Install or update now!", and a small installation program is started. The choises weren't too hard. In Select Packages, apart from the default, the only thing strictly needed is Python, found in the cathegory Interpreters (click on where it says "skip" to change what version is installed), and xorg-x11-base, found in X11. (More advanced users probably also want gcc etc., but this is a minimalistic guide. You can allways add packages later if you want.)

2.) FontForge next: At http://fontforge.sourceforge.net i followed the link to the File Release System, and there I downloaded the latest FontForge executable for Cygwin, and saved the file in my Cygwin tmp directory (e.g. C:\progra~1\cygwin\tmp). Then I started the Cygwin Bash Shell, and installed FontForge by writing:
  
  mkdir -p /usr/local/share/fontforge /usr/local/bin /usr/local/man/man1
  cd /tmp
  bunzip2 fontforge_cygwin*.bz2
  tar xfv fontforge_cygwin*.tar
  cd fontforge
  mv *.ui /usr/local/share/fontforge
  mv fontforge.1 /usr/local/man/man1
  mv fontforge.exe /usr/local/bin

FontForge is thus installed.

3.) Then I installed Potrace. From http://potrace.sourceforge.net/ I Just downloaded the precompiled distribution for Windows, and unzipped the file potrace.exe in a place included in my PATH variable, e.g. c:\windows\.

4.) Finally grcompiler...

...

When the necessary programs are installed, to compile Tengwar Telcontar from scratch, run

  ./compile

This will overwrite the files latinr.gdh, latinb.gdh, tengwarr.gdh, tengwarb.gdh, tengtelc_nogr.ttf and tengtelcb_nogr.ttf, so these must not be write protected.

If you only want to add modified Graphite programs to the included files tengtelc_nogr.ttf and tengtelcb_nogr.ttf, run

  addgr.bat

This way the graphite fonts tengtelc.ttf and tengtelcb.ttf are generated. Good luck!
