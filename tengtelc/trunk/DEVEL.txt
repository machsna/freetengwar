Tengwar Telcontar - a Unicode Tengwar font
Copyright (c) 2005-2010 Johan Winge

This file contains some very basic information on the structure of the tengtelc source files; in case you want to make modifications, this might help a little at least.

The short story: depending on what you want to do, you might want to take a look at regular.mf and bold.mf (for changing the width of the pen, for example), or tengenc.mf or tengwar.gdh (if you want to modify the encoding or the rendering behaviour).

The long story:

The python script mf2sfd.py provides the basic framework for converting the metafont sources into an outline vector font. Running "python mf2sfd.py foo" will run mf (metafont) on the file foo.mf, and then process the resulting foo.log file. From the log file, four files are extracted: foo.pe, foo.enc, foo.gdh, and unlink.pe. The file foo.pe, a FontForge script, is then run.

The generated script foo.pe traces the previously generated metafont bitmap font into a vector font, reencodes the glyphs according to the encoding vector foo.enc, and builds referenced characters out of the traced glyphs, all according to instructions ultimately provided in the metafont sources. A FontForge file foo.sfd is then generated.

The script mf2sfd.py is run on latinr.mf and tengwarr.mf, which are the base files for the latin and tengwar scripts. One font file for each script is generated, and finally, latinr.sfd and tengwarr.sfd are compiled into one font file with the script tengtelc.pe, and Graphite tables are added to it.

The following trees show which files are called from which:

compile
 |- "mf2sfd.py latinr"
 |   >- latinr.mf
 |       |- setup.mf
 |       |- regular.mf
 |       |   |- tracing.mf
 |       |   >- stroke.mf
 |       |      >- serif.mf
 |       >- latin.mf
 |
 |- "mf2sfd.py tengwarr"
 |   >- tengwarr.mf
 |       |- setup.mf
 |       |- regular.mf
 |       |   |- tracing.mf
 |       |   >- stroke.mf
 |       |      >- serif.mf
 |       >- tengwar.mf
 .           |- tengenc.mf
 .           |- stdteng.mf
 .           |- addteng.mf
             >- tehtar.mf

The file tracing.mf provides the subroutines which take care of the output of data to the log file.
         stroke.mf provides routines for drawing very flexible penstrokes.
         tengenc.mf defines the unicode encoding of tengwar characters.
 .       regular.mf sets the width and height of the pen used to draw all characters.

 |- "fontforge -script tengtelc.py regular"

 |     This compiles tengwarr.sfd and latinr.sfd into tengtelc.sfd, and generates tengtelc_nogr.ttf

 >- addgr.bat
     |- "grcompiler tengtelcr.gdl"
     |   |- latinr.gdh
     .   |- tengwarr.gdh
     .   |- latin.gdh
         >- tengwar.gdh

The files latinr.gdh and tengwarr.gdh are generated by mf2sfd.py. They contain mainly the location of the glyphs' attachpoints, which are defined in the metafont program, but now presented in a format that grcompiler understands.

Finally, the files latin.gdh and tengwar.gdh are the main Graphite source files, which control the smart font behaviour of tengtelc.

The above procedure is duplicated for the bold font, with the corresponding files.
