*** GENERIC COMPILING INSTRUCTIONS ***

The compilation of Tengwar Telcontar from source files to a working
Graphite ("smart font" enabled) TrueType typeface consists of two
steps: I.) the generating of bare TrueType fonts from the METAFONT
sources, and II.) adding Graphite tables to the resulting fonts.
You will only have to perform the first step if you want to add or
modify the glyphs in the typeface. If you only want to modify the
smart font behaviour of the typeface, i.e. rules for glyph
substitution and the like, you can skip the first step, and add the
modified Graphite tables to the bare precompiled TrueType fonts
that are also included in the source distribution.

Note: If you haven't done any changes to the METAFONT nor to the
Graphite sources, there is no reason (except for the sheer fun of
it) for you to recompile Tengwar Telcontar. Since a TrueType font
is platform independent (or should be...), you can just as well
use the binary distribution. In fact, I encourage you to do that
instead.

I.) To compile the Tengwar Telcontar source to TrueType font files,
   you will need the following software:

 0.) An OS that can run all of the following software, e.g. some
     Linux distribution of your choise, MacOS, or, if you use
     Windows, Cygwin: http://www.cygwin.com/

 1.) Python. This is probably included in your Linux distribution.
    (Don't forget to manually include it if/when you install Cygwin
    -- it isn't selected for installation by default.)

 2.) METAFONT. Usually comes boundled in TeX-distributions
    (e.g. MiKTeX, TeX Live, etc.).

 3.) FontForge. FontForge is continously being developed, so the
    latest version is strongly recommended. Note that the oldest
    usable version is 20090923.
    http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/

 4.) A tracing program, AutoTrace or potrace. I recommend the later:
    http://potrace.sourceforge.net/

II.) To add Graphite tables to the resulting fonts, you will need:

 0.) Graphite Compiler. Windows version available from:
    http://scripts.sil.org/GraphiteCompilerDownload

    Note: The file stddef.gdh that comes with GrCompiler might not
    be found by GrCompiler, and I have found that the easiest way
    to fix this is to copy the file stddef.gdh to the working
    directory of TengTelc. Otherwise you will get very cryptic
    errors when trying to add Graphite tables to the fonts.

    If you are using Ubuntu, you should use the SIL Ubuntu
    repository: http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu/


*** EXAMPLE OF COMPILATION UNDER WINDOWS XP ***

Here, as a reference, is how I set up a minimal system to compile
Tengwar Telcontar, starting from a normal Windows XP installation.
This guide has not been tested recently, and so might be out of date.

0.) First I went to http://www.cygwin.com/ and followed the link
"Install or update now!", and a small installation program is
started. The choises weren't too hard. In Select Packages, apart
from the default, the only thing strictly needed is Python, found
in the cathegory Interpreters (click on where it says "skip" to
change what version is installed), libpng and libxml2 in Libs,
tetex in Text, and XFree86-lib-compat, found in X11, as well as
all packages that get selected automatically together with these.
(More advanced users probably also want gcc etc., but this is a
minimalistic guide. You can always add packages later if you want.)

1.) FontForge next: The author of FontForge has posted very
detailed instructions on how to install FontForge in Cygwin.
Basically I did it the way he suggests:
http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/ms-install.html

2.) Then I installed Potrace. From http://potrace.sourceforge.net/
I Just downloaded the precompiled distribution for Windows, and
unzipped the file potrace.exe in a place included in your $PATH.
I used c:\cygwin\usr\local\bin\. (Obviously, you will have to adapt
to where you installed Cygwin.)

3.) Finally I downloaded the latest version of GrCompiler from
http://scripts.sil.org/GraphiteCompilerDownload
and unzipped all the files into c:\Program files\grcompiler\
and then added this path to the PATH variable. (Open the Control
Panel, System, Advanced, Environment Variables, and then edit Path,
by appending something like ";c:\Program files\grcompiler\"
(without quotation marks). The exact appearance of the path is of
course dependent on where you installed GrCompiler.)

I also moved the file stddef.gdh as per the note above.

Note: When adding the path to PATH, do not use quotation marks. If
you do, Cygwin can't understand it correctly, and the grcompiler
will not be found. (In cygwin, check with "echo $PATH" that
everything is alright.)

4.) When the necessary programs are installed, unpack the source
package of Tengwar Telcontar to a folder inside Cygwin's virtual
file system. Then open up a Cygwin shell, move to the location
where the source files reside, and type the following command:

  . ./compile

This way Tengwar Telcontar is compiled from scratch. In the
process, the files latinr.gdh, latinb.gdh, tengwarr.gdh,
tengwarb.gdh, tengtelc_nogr.ttf and tengtelcb_nogr.ttf will be
overwritten.

(If you only want to add modified Graphite programs to the included
files tengtelc_nogr.ttf and tengtelcb_nogr.ttf, it suffices to run
addgr.bat.)

This way the graphite fonts tengtelc.ttf and tengtelcb.ttf are
generated.

Good luck!


*** EXAMPLE OF COMPILATION UNDER UBUNTU 10.10 MAVERICK MEERKAT ***

These instructions work on a clean installation of Maverick, but I hope
that it will give you some guidance how to compile TengTelc on other
Linux distributions as well.

1.) Install grcompiler. You can choose to install a precompiled version
by adding the SIL repository to your list of repositories:

  sudo wget http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu/sil.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
  echo "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu maverick main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install grcompiler

If you are using another Ubuntu version, replace "maverick" in the 
second line with the relevant name: to find the codename of your
Ubuntu distribution, run "lsb_release -a".

If, for some reason, the SIL repository does not work for you, or if
you prefer not to use it, you can compile grcompiler yourself:

  sudo apt-get install subversion build-essential automake libtool gettext libicu-dev libgraphite-dev docbook2x
  svn co http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/graphite/grcompiler/trunk@1157 grcompiler
  cd grcompiler
  autoreconf -i
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

(The program is continuously being developed. The suffix @1157 in
the second line specifies a fixed version which has been confirmed to
work. You might want to test a later version; simply remove the suffix
to download the latest one.)

2.) Install FontForge. You can download a precompiled version:

  sudo apt-get install fontforge

As long as the version (date) is 20090923 or later, this will work.
However, I would recommend instead that you compile FontForge yourself:

  sudo apt-get build-dep fontforge
  sudo apt-get install git
  git clone git://fontforge.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/fontforge/fontforge
  cd fontforge

At this stage you can choose to include a patch that restores an older
bezier simplification routine, which I think gives a better result.
This is optional of course:

  cd fontforge
  patch < path/to/tengtelc/fontforge.patch
  cd ..

The regular compilation continues:

  ./configure --enable-pasteafter --enable-double
  make
  make install

You can of course configure FontForge to your liking; this is simply
what I use. For further details, see
http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/source-build.html#src-source
http://openfontlibrary.org/wiki/How_to_install_FontForge

3.) Install the rest of the necessary software. Conveniently, all
programs that are needed are available from the repositories:

  sudo apt-get install python texlive potrace

4.) Finally enter the directory where the tengtelc source code
resides, and do

  ./compile

That's it! (You might want to verify that a new font indeed has been
produced, so that you don't end up using the precompiled version.)

5.) To test the font, you can compile the XeLaTeX document testcase.tex:

  sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex ttf-sil-gentium
  xelatex testcase.tex

Open testcase.pdf to verify that the rendering works correctly.
